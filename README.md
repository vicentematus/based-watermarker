# Based Watermark proof of concept

Works with the library watermark.js (which is outdated but i haven't found any library for this specific purpose). Start up with Vite.

## Limitations
- Can't copy to clipboard the image. You need to right click it.
- It's really simple right now.
- No filetype validation.
- Runs on client side

## Installation

To get started install pnpm globally first.
```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

Then install the packages

```
pnpm install
```

And run dev server with

```
pnpm run dev
```
